## 🌟 Key Features

* **Orbital Mechanics**: Dynamic planet rotation with orbital decay and moon spawning systems.
* **Combat System**: Physics-based "Spike & Chain" mechanics for grappling and attacking.
* **Multiplayer**: Fully implemented split-screen multiplayer support with lobby and join mechanics.
* **Visuals**: Custom sprite work, normal mapping, and dynamic lighting effects.
* **UI/UX**: Comprehensive HUD, minimap, score systems, and polished menus.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Unity Hub**
* **Unity Editor** (Check `GamesFleadhProject/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` for the exact version)

### Installation

## 👥 The Team & Contributions

This project combines the work of five developers, with specific roles broken down below:

### **Carl Byrne**
* **Physics & Audio**: Planet rotational scripting (orbital decay), moon spawning/rotation mechanics, and music/sound production.

### **Peter Conroy**
* **Art & Polish**: Sprite work (home planets, ships, backgrounds, lettering), multiplayer implementation, camera scripts, and trailer editing.

### **Seán Daniel**
* **Systems & UI**: Score system (value indicators), timer scripting, Title Scene/Endscreen implementation, and sprite work (moons, HUD, chains).

### **Samson Glover**
* **Core Mechanics & Lighting**: Player controls (aiming, flying), Spike & Chain logic, normal mapping, lighting configuration, and bug fixing.

### **Sam McAulay**
* **Gameplay & Logic**: Player mechanics, joint collision attachments, world/screen borders, minimap, and lobby screen mechanics.
